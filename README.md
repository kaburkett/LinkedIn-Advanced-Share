<a href="http://datopstech.com/linkedin-share-tool/"><h3>Live Version</h3></a>

## Purpose

This tool allows you to type a post, link to content, and strategically select the image you want to display with the post.

LinkedIn's documentation can be sparce in some areas. The goal of this utility is also to bring a little more clarity to the potential uses of their API.

Click the live version link above to use this tool. The only thing that needs to be edited to run this tool privately is the API key on line 20 in index.html

I developed this tool to solve the problem mentioned on LinkedIn's help thread (users wanted to be able to select images for sites they share even if they don't have access to the site's source code).

## Note: Usage Of This Utility Requires API Key From LinkedIn

You can register and obtain an api key on their development portal here:
