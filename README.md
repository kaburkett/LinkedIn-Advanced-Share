This tool allows you to type a post, link to content, and strategically select the image you want to display with the post.

Click the live version link above to use this tool. The only thing that needs to be edited to run this tool privately is the API key on line 20 of the index.

I developed this tool to solve the problem mentioned on LinkedIn's help thread here: <a href="http://community.linkedin.com/questions/3299/image-displayed-when-sharing-a-website.html">Click Here</a>.
